- **Validation**: Empty notes cannot be added to the list.
- **View Notes**: All created notes are displayed in an intuitive and responsive layout.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove any note with a simple click.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes with an appealing user interface.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend framework.

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/notes-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

## Usage

1. **Add a Note**: Type your note in the input field and click the **Add Note** button.

## Key Features in Code

- **Validation Logic**:
  - Prevent empty string addition:
    ```javascript
    if (note.trim() === "") {
      alert("Note cannot be empty!");
      return;
    }
    ```
  - Prevent duplicate note addition:
    ```javascript
    if (notes.includes(note)) {
      alert("Duplicate notes are not allowed!");
      return;
    }
    ```



## Future Improvements

- Add categories or tags for notes.
